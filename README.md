# API for the Overhands application
##### ⚠️ In progress ⚠️
API express.js to serve as the backend for my undergraduate thesis, the mobile application for learning sign language: Overhands.

## ❗ Atention
Before starting the API, it is important to have the development environment ready, dependencies such as mysql and minIO. For this, it is recommended to use the docker service to load this development environment. If you have docker installed, to upload the container, just use the command `yarn docker-run`.

## 🚀 How to run the project
Use the command `yarn install` to install the dependences, then you need to create a file called `.env` following the ".env.example" template file in the projet. Later, use `yarn dev` or `yarn start`.

## 🛠️ Built with

* Node.js
* Express
